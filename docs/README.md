# Kotlin Bloc

An implementation of the [Bloc pattern](https://www.didierboelens.com/2018/08/reactive-programming---streams---bloc) for Kotlin and Jetpack Compose, heavily inspired by Felix Angelov's *excellent* [Bloc](https://bloclibrary.dev/) library for Dart/Flutter.

?> A lot of the documentation you see here has been directly ported over from the Dart/Flutter [Bloc library](https://bloclibrary.dev). Huge credit to the maintainers of that package, who've written some amazing documentation and tutorials.
